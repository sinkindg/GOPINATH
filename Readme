To architect a scalable and secure static web application in AWS, we can follow the steps below:

Set up an Amazon EC2 instance:

Choose an appropriate EC2 instance type and size based on your application's requirements.
Create a new EC2 instance and select the desired operating system (e.g., Amazon Linux).
Configure security groups to allow inbound traffic only on necessary ports (e.g., SSH, HTTP, HTTPS).
Install and configure a web server:

Use a configuration management tool like Ansible, Puppet, or Chef to automate the installation and configuration of the web server.
Install a web server software such as Nginx or Apache.
Configure the web server to serve the static content (HTML page) by creating a site configuration file with appropriate settings.
Secure the application and enable HTTPS:

Generate a self-signed SSL/TLS certificate using OpenSSL or an automated tool like Let's Encrypt (if you prefer a trusted certificate).
Configure the web server to use the generated SSL/TLS certificate for HTTPS.
Redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS by adding a server block or rewrite rule in the web server configuration.
Automate the deployment and configuration:

Use a configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible) to define the desired state of the server and automate the deployment process.
Write Ansible playbooks or equivalent configuration files to install packages, copy configuration files, and start/restart the web server.
Automated tests for server configuration:

Write test cases to validate the correctness of the server configuration.
Use a testing framework like Selenium, pytest, or a simple HTTP request library to perform tests.
Examples of tests could include verifying the response status code, content validation, and checking the redirection from HTTP to HTTPS.
Deploy the web application:

Use the chosen configuration management tool (e.g., Ansible) to deploy the web application code to the server.
Copy the HTML file to the appropriate location on the server.
Restart the web server to make sure the changes take effect.
By following these steps, you will have a scalable and secure static web application deployed in AWS. Remember to adjust the instructions based on your specific requirements and the configuration management tool of your choice.
